- **Dataset from Kaggle.**

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Explore the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of fish species, relationships between different features, and any patterns that may be present.**

## Modeling
- **Polynomial Regression was employed for model training, and the performance evaluation relied on the R2 score.**

## Kaggle Notebook
